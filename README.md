## ESTL ##

The ESTL is a C++ STL-like library for embedded developers. It is a library
that is designed for memory-constrained embedded C++ applications. This
library uses no new or delete. It is highly tested and should be quite
portable. It uses only C++ 98 features due to compiler limitations on
some of the target platforms that are currently in use.

We are including a vector class here but there is more to come! For
more details, check out our [ESTL](https://esrlabs.com/blog/estl-for-embedded-developers/).
